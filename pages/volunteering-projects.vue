                <br />
                <br />Due to open border and weak law, day by day various incidents of human trafficking and abduction are increasing in Nepal. As per the data, the districts from where more and more women are being sold i.e. Sindhupalchok, Makawanpur, Dhading, Kavre, Rasuwa, Dang, Kailali, Siraha, Saptari and Udayapur. Especially more girls above 9 years to 16 years girls are being sold and less girls above 16 years are being sold every year. The girl seller brokers are selling daughters of straight, illiterate family by marrying, in the pretext of good job and giving other greed in brothels of Delhi and Mumbai.
                <br />
                <br />Due to illiterate, religious superstition, lack of self reliant, the Nepali girls are being compelled to follow broker husband after the marriage. Having hope of pleasure and visiting city, the brokers use them as sex slave and sell them owner of brothels. Such a way prostitute girl should satisfy 15 to 20 customers per day having sex with them. If she rejects to have sex with any customer or customer does not satisfy with her, they tortured mentally and physically and battered and got engaged in prostitution. After knowing that she is affected by HIV, they banished from the brothel. Some women banished from the brothel return in native country and some wait for the customer in red-light area. The society hates and rejected such returned women, thus, their conditions found terrible. Therefore, our organization has been operating awareness and educative programs in the districts where girls are trafficked in large numbers. We are operating programs to rescue the girls from brothels, girls from boarder who are being sold to brothels and appropriate care to those who are returned by affecting from HIV and awareness program in the society not to hate and insult them. We have prepared volunteering program to rescue sold and to be sold girls, rehabilitation and make available skill training and knowledge to the HIV affected woman.
                <br />
                <br />Therefore, we request to participate in rescue of sold and to be sold girl, rehabilitation, social awareness campaign and volunteer program against human trafficking. Therefore, we invite entire volunteers of the world to donate and contribute your effort in society; letâ€™s join our Girl/Women trafficking volunteer project.

                      Education, raising of public awareness and training are linked to virtually all areas in Agenda/21, and even more closely to the ones on meeting basic needs, capacity-building, data and information, science, and the role of major groups. This chapter sets out broad proposals, while specific suggestions related to sectoral issues are contained in other chapters.
                      <br />
                      <br />The Declaration and Recommendations of the Tbilisi Intergovernmental Conference on Environmental Education/1/ organized by UNESCO and UNEP and held in 1977, have provided the fundamental principles for the proposals in this document.Education, including formal education, public awareness and training should be recognized as a process by which human beings and societies can reach their fullest potential.Education is critical for promoting sustainable development and improving the capacity of the people to address environment and development issues. While basic education provides the underpinning for any environmental and development education, the latter needs to be incorporated as an essential part of learning.

                Both formal and non-formal education are indispensable to changing people's attitudes so that they have the capacity to assess and address their sustainable development concerns.
                It is also critical for achieving environmental and ethical awareness, values and attitudes, skills and behaviour consistent with sustainable development and for effective public participation in decision-making.
                <br />
                <br />To be effective, environment and development education should deal with the dynamics of both the physical/biological and socio-economic environment and human (which may include spiritual) development, should be integrated in all disciplines, and should employ formal and non-formal methods and effective means of communication.
