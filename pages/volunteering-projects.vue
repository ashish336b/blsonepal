Trafficking, kidnapping are extraordinary issues in our Nepali society which is fretful by the absence of education. Massage parlors and sex houses are empowering Girl Trafficking. Such a way, abductors agents are snatching or instigating youngsters and handing them over for abduction, engaging them as child labour in various factories and selling for organ transplant.

                      <br />Yearly, around 5 to 7 thousand Nepali ladies are being sold in massage parlors as sex specialist. Moreover, around 2 hundred thousand Nepali ladies are being constrained by working sex business in different houses of ill-repute of India. Specialists flexibly Nepali ladies by accepting tremendous sums as commission from outside the brothel by promoting that they would get work liberated from cost. Because of open outskirt and frail law, step by step different occurrences of human dealing and kidnapping are expanding in Nepal. Particularly more young ladies over 9 years to 16 years young ladies are being sold and less young ladies over 16 years are being sold each year.

Having any desire for delight and visiting city, the representatives use them as sex slave and sell them proprietor of houses of ill-repute. Girls tormented intellectually and truly and battered and got occupied with prostitution. In the wake of realizing that she is influenced by HIV, they ousted her from the house of ill-repute. A few ladies ousted from the massage parlor return in the local nation and some hang tight for the client in the red-light region. Society loathes and rejects them, in this manner, their conditions are discovered horrendous.

                      Education, raising of public awareness and training are linked to virtually all areas in Agenda/21, and even more closely to the ones on meeting basic needs, capacity-building, data and information, science, and the role of major groups. This chapter sets out broad proposals, while specific suggestions related to sectoral issues are contained in other chapters.
                      <br />
                      <br />The Declaration and Recommendations of the Tbilisi Intergovernmental Conference on Environmental Education/1/ organized by UNESCO and UNEP and held in 1977, have provided the fundamental principles for the proposals in this document.Education, including formal education, public awareness and training should be recognized as a process by which human beings and societies can reach their fullest potential.Education is critical for promoting sustainable development and improving the capacity of the people to address environment and development issues. While basic education provides the underpinning for any environmental and development education, the latter needs to be incorporated as an essential part of learning.

                Both formal and non-formal education are indispensable to changing people's attitudes so that they have the capacity to assess and address their sustainable development concerns.
                It is also critical for achieving environmental and ethical awareness, values and attitudes, skills and behaviour consistent with sustainable development and for effective public participation in decision-making.
                <br />
                <br />To be effective, environment and development education should deal with the dynamics of both the physical/biological and socio-economic environment and human (which may include spiritual) development, should be integrated in all disciplines, and should employ formal and non-formal methods and effective means of communication.
